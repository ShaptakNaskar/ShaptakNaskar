## Hey, I’m Shaptak 👋

🚀 **AI-Assisted Developer & Automation Enthusiast**  
📍 Kolkata, India

I build practical, AI-powered automation tools that turn repetitive workflows into clean, reliable systems.  
My work mostly lives around **Python**, **AI APIs**, and **backend automation** — especially Gmail & Google Workspace integrations, bots, and script-driven solutions.

I’m passionate about simplifying business and creative processes, and I genuinely enjoy experimenting with AI-driven workflows, PC hardware, and gaming in my free time.
